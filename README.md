## July 16th, 2024 Update

🚨 **We just posted the PDF of Unity Lab #1 – you can download it here: [Unity Lab #1](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fifth-edition/raw/main/Unity_Labs/Unity_Lab_1.pdf)** 🚨

We're thrilled to announce that we'll start posting PDFs of the Unity Lab projects from the book, so you can dive in and start building right away! Stay tuned for these resources and get ready to elevate your development skills with "Head First C#".

One of the exciting aspects of writing the 5th edition of "Head First C#" is how we've integrated Unity to teach not just game development, but also broader development concepts that help new learners become great developers. 🌟

To make the learning experience even more hands-on and engaging, we've included Unity Lab projects throughout the book. These labs provide step-by-step guides to building exciting projects while reinforcing key programming concepts.

Stay tuned as we continue to update our GitHub page while the book is getting printed!

## July 11, 2024 Update

We've got great news! We just finished production, which means the book is officially headed to the printer and will be available online and in stores in a few weeks.

We'll get a PDF of the first four chapters posted very soon, as well as PDFs of the .NET MAUI and Unity projects, the Blazor learner's guide, and other new material. We're also working on video walkthroughs to post to our [YouTube channel]([url](https://www.youtube.com/@headfirstcsharp)).

If you're a 4th edition reader, watch this space—we'll post all of the new material in the 5th edition as free PDFs so you can stay up to date without having to buy a new copy of the book.

## MAUI Project Preview

One of the most exciting additions to Head First C# is the inclusion of .NET MAUI, Microsoft's new cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. You can find early release versions of the projects in the [MAUI_Projects folder](MAUI_Projects/), and code for the projects in the [Code folder](Code/).

## Unity Labs

Welcome to your first Head First C# Unity Lab. Writing code is a skill, and like any other skill, getting better at it takes practice and experimentation. Unity will be a really valuable tool for that.

Unity is a cross-platform game development tool that you can use to make professional-quality games, simulations, and more. It’s also a fun and satisfying way to get practice with the C# tools and ideas you’ll learn throughout this book. We designed these short, targeted labs to reinforce the concepts and techniques you just learned to help you hone your C# skills. These labs valuable practice, even if you aren’t planning to write games in C#.

You can download early release PDFs of the Unity Labs from the [Unity Labs folder](Unity_Labs/).
